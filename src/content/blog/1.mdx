# Discovering Independence with CaredFor: A Personal Journey

Hello! I'm Carol, residing in the charm-filled city of Dallas. Embarking on the journey of aging was a concept foreign to me until I hit 66. Suddenly, changes in my health and energy weren't just noticeable; they were significant. No longer was life about the hustle and bustle, but rather, prioritizing health, independence, and safety within the comfort of my home became essential. Amidst these priorities, cultivating strong friendships and indulging in my passions remained unchanged.

One might wonder, what's my secret weapon? It's my passion for aiding folks like myself, who are aging solo at home, in maintaining their independence and safety. My zeal for research and writing has propelled me to construct courses, guidebooks, and roadmaps tailored for individuals 50 and above, guiding them as they navigate their golden years.

Looking ahead, I'm excited about a couple of adventures on the horizon; a trip to Montreal being one, and embarking on the novel-writing journey being the other. As for books, Jennifer Robson's historical fiction works captivate me, and "Racing in the Rain" always brings tears to my eyes yet warms my heart.

Curious about my daily routine? It starts with a moment of prayer and gratitude, followed by the ritual of my morning coffee, yoga, and stretching. Then, it's time to tackle the day's to-do list, guided by the principle of completing tasks and ending the day with a thankful heart.

Walking, reading, and exploring new places—be it serene beaches or majestic mountains—are among my cherished activities. And throughout it all, a quote that guides me is to seek serenity in acceptance, courage for change, and wisdom to distinguish between the two.

To those navigating life solo, my advice is to plan ahead with a clear vision, actively seek community connections, and always remain open to new possibilities.
