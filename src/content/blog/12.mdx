# Navigating Through COVID with Care

"In the journey of each day, there's a bold step to take: rising from bed with optimism." - Mason Cooley

For reliable updates on the pandemic, we suggest keeping tabs through the Johns Hopkins tracker and the New York Times website, both of which are refreshed frequently throughout the day.

**What's New?**  
Currently, there are no significant updates besides the ongoing tally of cases.

**Activities for Indoors**  
CaredFor has crafted an in-depth guide for staying active, connected, and healthy during these challenging times, titled "Staying Social while Practicing Social Distancing." An exciting tip from the guide highlights how Planet Fitness offers free, daily workout sessions live on their Facebook Page.

**A Glimmer of Hope**  
A shining piece of news: In the opening quarter of 2020, Germany was successful in generating over half of its electricity from renewable energy sources!

**What We're Loving Right Now**  
We're currently enchanted by Monty Don's "Italian Gardens" series on Netflix. Monty Don, a British author and television presenter, brings an infectious joy to the world of plants and landscape design. This series is a must-watch for those who admire the beauty of nature and cultivated spaces.

**Parting Thoughts**  
Reflecting on the bigger picture, it all circles back to the power of the community. As the former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger aptly put it, "At the end of the day... it goes back to people power. And 'we the people' have the power to contribute by simply staying home."

Join us again tomorrow, and don't miss out on our technology habits survey closing early next week!

-With heartfelt intentions, from the Team at CaredFor
