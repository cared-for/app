In these challenging times, as we navigate the uncertainties brought by COVID-19, it's vital to remember Maya Angelou's words, "We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated." To keep abreast of the pandemic's developments, we suggest following the Johns Hopkins tracker and the New York Times website, both of which are frequently updated with the latest numbers.

### Recent Recommendations

Acorns offers insightful articles to guide you through cost-cutting methods.

### A Dose of Positivity

A plan is being considered to move the league to a quarantined island, enabling the season to continue on television, signifying a step toward returning to our cherished routines and activities.

We'll be back with more updates on Monday. Stay informed, stay safe, and let's look after each other during these times.
