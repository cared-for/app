# New Daily Check-In Update for CaredFor: Keeping Loved Ones in the Loop

In a world where staying connected is more important than ever before, we at CaredFor are excited to announce an important update that's all about keeping your emergency contacts in the loop. We've listened to your feedback and understand that during difficult times, knowing your loved ones are safe and sound can greatly ease your mind. Therefore, we’re introducing an optional feature that allows emergency contacts to be notified when their loved one checks in daily.

Traditionally, CaredFor has operated on a basis where contacts are alerted only if a check-in is missed. We've seen how this can sometimes leave family and friends feeling anxious, wondering if everything is alright on days when everything is actually just fine. To combat this, we’re making a shift.

With this new update, the power of choice remains with our users. You decide whether your emergency contacts receive daily notifications of your check-ins. It’s all about what makes you comfortable. If you choose, your contacts could now receive a little email each day letting them know not just that you're OK, but also sharing the time and city of your check-in. Imagine the peace of mind this could offer them, especially if you're someone who travels. Plus, to add a personal touch, your daily "Quote of the Day" will be included in the message, sharing a piece of your day with them.

Here’s the catch – your consent is key! If the idea of daily check-ins being shared doesn’t suit you or your lifestyle, no problem. Your contacts won’t receive the daily updates and will only be informed if a check-in is missed, just like before. We want to ensure this new feature enhances your experience with CaredFor without compromising your comfort.

Our main goal with introducing daily check-in notifications is to reduce the worry and uncertainty that can come from not knowing. Whether you opt into this feature or not, rest assured the control is entirely in your hands. By offering this flexibility, we hope to cater to the different needs and preferences of our users and their loved ones, making the CaredFor experience even more supportive and reassuring.
