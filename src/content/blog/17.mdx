# Empowering Independence for Seniors: Practical Ways to Secure Safety at Home

As we grow older, our definition of independence evolves. For many seniors, living independently means continuing to enjoy life in the comfort of their own home. Gone are the days when the only options were to either live at home without support or move into a nursing home. Nowadays, numerous tools, resources, and small businesses are available to help seniors maintain an independent lifestyle at home.

For those eager to preserve their independence in their golden years, it's crucial to explore and understand the myriad of options out there. Aging might mean needing a bit extra help here and there, tweaking your living space for better safety, or tapping into community resources. Embracing these small changes can significantly enhance your life at home.

## What Does Senior Independence Look Like?

Every individual values different aspects of aging at home. Key to this is ensuring safety, security, and having basic needs met. Here's what senior independence can mean:

- **Total independence**: Living without any assistance at home.
- **Some assistance**: Staying at home with help for personal care, etc.
- **Live-in care**: Having a caregiver dwell with you 24/7 or living with family members.
- **Assisted living with independence**: Enjoying services like prepared meals and activities while keeping your autonomy.
- **Full assisted living**: Where staff are available around the clock for your needs.

Modifications to your daily routines or home layout can empower you to stay at home and keep your independence intact.

## Accessing Personal Care Services

Choosing to stay home might mean reaching out for help, especially as everyday tasks become challenging. Various services can ease these daily living activities. Start by exploring resources through the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging which can guide you to local aid. Friends, libraries, community bulletins, and online searches are also valuable sources to find the support you need.

Services to consider include meal or grocery delivery to ensure a nutritious diet, personal hygiene assistance, and daily exercise programs to keep you mobile and strong.

## Home Modifications for Safety and Independence

Feeling safe at home sometimes requires physical alterations. These modifications range from small adjustments like shower mats for better traction and bathroom handrails, to more considerable investments like carpeting to prevent slips or installing chair lifts.

It's wise to make these adaptations sooner rather than later, ideally before any issues arise. Consider making your living environment more senior-friendly by evaluating potential changes to flooring, stairs, and contemplating downsizing to a more manageable living situation.

## Navigating Medical Care and Keeping Social

Staying on top of your health is vital for continued independence at home. If transportation is an issue, look into options like family assistance, public transport, or rideshare apps like Uber or Lyft for travel to medical appointments.

Consider utilizing technology like the CaredFor app for daily wellness check-ins, ensuring that both you and your loved ones have peace of mind regarding your well-being.

Keeping active socially is equally important for mental health. Leverage technology like video chats, emails, and social media to maintain connections with friends and family. If getting around is tricky, rideshare services can offer a safe means to join in social activities.
