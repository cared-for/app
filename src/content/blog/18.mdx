# Staying in Touch Easily with CaredFor: A Guide to Using FaceTime

In the age of technology, staying connected with your loved ones has never been easier, thanks to tools like FaceTime. Whether you're a newcomer or just looking for a refresher on how to use it, this guide is for you.

If you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you're in luck! You have FaceTime. This fantastic app lets you see and talk to your family and friends as if you were right there with them. Want to check out your sibling's new place? Or see a friend's new pet? FaceTime makes it possible.

FaceTime isn't just for special occasions like birthdays; it's perfect for everyday catch-ups too. Let's dive into what FaceTime is, which devices you can use it on, and how to make calls.

### What is FaceTime?

It's a video-calling app created by Apple. Most Apple gadgets come with FaceTime pre-installed, so you're probably ready to start calling right away.

With FaceTime, you can make video or audio calls - all you need is Wi-Fi or a data plan. Now, let's see if your device is ready for FaceTime.

### Can My Device Use FaceTime?

To use FaceTime, you need an Apple product - sorry, no Androids here. But, if you've got an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or iPod Touch, you're set. You'll spot the FaceTime app on your device's home screen if it's one of the compatible ones. For video calls, an iPhone 4 or newer should work just fine.

### Let's Get Calling

Calling with FaceTime is similar to making a regular phone call, but you'll be face-to-face on your screen. Here's how to get started on your iPhone:

1. **Make Sure FaceTime is On:** Check in your settings to ensure FaceTime is activated.
2. **Place a Call:** You can call from your contacts or directly via the FaceTime app.
   - For contacts, look them up, tap the video icon, and start ringing.
   - Using the FaceTime app, tap the plus sign, type the contact's info, and hit the video button.

To call from your iPad, Mac, or iPod Touch, the steps are pretty similar. Just make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi, sign in to FaceTime, and dial up your friend or family member.
