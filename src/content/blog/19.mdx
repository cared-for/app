# Understanding ADLs and IADLs: A Guide to Independence and Care

As we grow older, deciding how to maintain our independence while ensuring our own safety can be challenging. Achieving a high quality of life is intricately connected to our ability to carry out everyday tasks on our own. These tasks are known as ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) and IADLs (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), terms introduced by Dr. Sidney Katz to help evaluate an individual’s capacity for self-care and independent living. If you or someone you care about is finding these daily tasks difficult, there are numerous supportive measures available to foster independence (more details to follow).

So, what exactly are ADLs and IADLs, and why are they crucial for our well-being? How can you assess your or your loved one’s capability in managing these activities? And if a family member is struggling with ADLs or IADLs, how can you approach this sensitive topic effectively? This guide aims to address these questions and assist you in forming a plan that best suits your family’s needs.

## What Are ADLs and IADLs?

ADLs and IADLs serve as benchmarks to determine if an older adult is suited for living independently or if they require more comprehensive care. Understanding these terms is essential for both aging individuals and their caregivers.

### What Are ADLs?

ADLs are fundamental tasks necessary for everyday living. From childhood, we learn skills such as bathing, dressing, and feeding ourselves. However, these tasks may become more challenging with age. The CDC notes that individuals over 75 years old are significantly more likely to face difficulties with ADLs compared to those between 65 and 74 years old.

ADLs cover essential self-care activities like:
- Bathing and showering
- Personal hygiene maintenance
- Dressing and choosing appropriate outfits
- Feeding oneself
- Functional mobility, like standing up from a seated position
- Using the restroom independently

### What Are IADLs?

IADLs entail more complex tasks than ADLs, often requiring better organization, critical thinking, or physical effort. These are skills we acquire in our school years and include managing a household, communicating effectively, and other chores.

While not critical for basic survival, IADLs are key indicators of an individual’s ability to live independently. Activities encompassed by IADLs include:
- Handling personal finances and bill payments
- Doing household chores and maintenance
- Preparing meals
- Managing communications, like mail or phone calls
- Transporting oneself for appointments
- Administering medications correctly

## Why Are ADLs and IADLs Important?

Recognizing limitations in ADLs and IADLs helps identify when a loved one may need additional support or a transition to a care facility. "Independent living" can mean different things to different people, so it’s crucial to evaluate your loved one’s capabilities on a case-by-case basis.

For instance, an ADL evaluation for bathing might categorize someone’s ability in various ways ranging from completely independent to entirely dependent, guiding decisions on the level of care needed.

### Addressing Limitations in IADLs

When a loved one has difficulty with IADLs, it doesn’t immediately mean they need assisted living. Arranging a care plan might better support their desire for independence. This could include financial management tactics, meal preparation services, or hiring occasional help for maintaining their home.

## Introducing CaredFor for Peace of Mind

Discussing the need for assistance with ADLs and IADLs can be challenging, especially when it involves family. It’s vital to approach each conversation with compassion, focusing on proactive solutions. In these scenarios, utilizing resources like the CaredFor App could make a significant difference. CaredFor enables daily check-ins, ensuring your loved one’s safety and offering you peace of mind.

Helping your aging family member or friend navigate their capabilities and needs concerning ADLs and IADLs is a profound act of care. Remember, seeking help and creating a supportive environment can enhance their quality of life, allowing them to retain as much independence as possible while ensuring their safety.
