# Community Spotlight: Kathy's Journey with CaredFor

Meet Kathy, a vibrant soul residing in Oakland, California, her birthplace and current home after many years spent living in various cities across the United States and even an enchanting stint in Paris, France. Since her retirement in 2010, Kathy has been passionately involved in her community, devoting her time to assisting with childcare, including her two grandchildren, and volunteering at the Oakland Zoo and St. John's Episcopal Church.

Kathy sees her ability to spread joy and laughter in everything she does as her personal superpower. She eagerly looks forward to a trip to NYC and Ireland, finding joy in travel and the simple pleasures of life. Her love for reading spans titles like "Prince of Tides" and "Little Women," showcasing her diverse interests.

A typical day for Kathy starts with checking in on her CaredFor app, a tool she thanks for its helpful reminders. She spends her mornings engaged in volunteer work, followed by afternoons dedicated to ferrying kids to their after-school activities. For Kathy, success comes from fulfilling her obligations, making life easier for someone else, avoiding sugar, and, most importantly, having fun.

Kathy's adventures have taken her across Europe, but she's just as content with a cozy road trip closer to home, provided the weather isn't too warm. Among her favorite quotes are reminders to stay present, cherish memories, and do the best one can with what's available.

As someone who lives alone, Kathy emphasizes the importance of finding a CaredFor buddy to ensure safety and companionship. She advocates for volunteering and helping those in need as ways to enrich one's life and the lives of others. Despite the challenges of aging, with creaky joints and a cranky brain at times, Kathy chooses to stay active and contribute positively to the world.

Her story is an inspiring reminder of the joy of giving, the importance of community, and the value of staying connected through services like CaredFor, especially as we navigate the later chapters of our lives.
