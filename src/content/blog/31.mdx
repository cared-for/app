# Maximizing Safety for Seniors: Preventing Falls in the Bathroom with CaredFor

Falling is a huge concern for older folks. Did you know? Out of six falls, four happen right at home. That's a lot, right? This tells us how important it is to make our homes safer, especially for our grandmas and grandpas who want to keep living independently, feeling good and secure.

To turn a home into a safe haven, there are some neat tricks like swapping slippery floors with cozy carpets, fixing handrails, and even rethinking the bedroom location. And don't forget the bathroom - it plays a big part in daily life!

To reduce the chances of taking a tumble in the bathroom, grabbing onto bars, stepping on non-slip mats, and a handy night light can make a big difference. And there's more: a shower chair is a game-changer as it lets you shower while sitting down, cutting down on the risk of falls.

### A Look into Shower Safety and Avoiding Slippery Situations for Elders 

A shocking number of seniors, more than a third, experience a fall each year, and bathrooms are particularly risky spots. Getting in and out of showers or tubs can often lead to slips. But with a few bathroom tweaks like adding shower chairs and non-slip coverings, we can make this space a lot safer and keep bath time enjoyable.

### Simple Tips for Shower Safety:

- **Balance Exercises**: Chat with a physical therapist about exercises that can boost your balance. Seated ones could be really helpful!
- **Non-Slip Mats**: These are great for adding grip and preventing slips.
- **Grab Bars**: Installing these helps with balance when getting in and out of the bath or shower.
- **Night Light**: Keeping your bathroom well-lit makes it easier to stay balanced.
- **Shower Chair**: Opt for a comfortable chair to sit on while showering. This can help avoid falls in the bath.
