# Creating a Fall Prevention and Recovery Plan with CaredFor

Falling down isn't something anyone looks forward to, especially as we get older. But did you know that falls are actually the top reason older people get hurt? It's true, and it's why knowing how to stay safe from falls, and how to get back up if you do fall, is super important for staying healthy and independent at home. We're going to talk about how you can make your home safer to prevent falls and what to do if a fall happens. Remember, this advice is just to help you think about what you might needâ€”it's not the same as getting advice from a doctor or physical therapist.

## How to Make Your Home Fall-Proof

Your home should be your safe space, but sometimes it needs a little tweaking to keep it that way. Here are some easy things you can do to help prevent falls:

- Put non-slip mats in places where you might slip, like the bathroom or kitchen.
- Install handrails and grab bars where you need them, like in the bathroom and on stairs.
- Take away any rugs that make the floor uneven, and think about using carpet instead of hard floors.
- Put night lights around so you can see better when it's dark.

## How to Keep Yourself Strong and Balanced

Staying active is super important for keeping your muscles strong and your balance sharp. Here's how:

- Join exercise classes made for older people at places like your local library or YMCA.
- Focus on exercises that make you stronger and help with balance, like weight training, more than just cardio exercises.
- Work on exercises that make your core muscles stronger, as this helps with balance.
- Try yoga to improve your balance and flexibility.

## Getting Help From Your Friends and Family

It's hard to ask for help, but your friends, family, and healthcare team can be great partners in preventing falls. Start planning now:

- Tell your friends and family about your fall prevention plan. They can be your emergency contacts.
- Find a physical therapist who can help you practice how to safely get back up if you fall.
- Make sure your medical information and emergency contacts are easily found in your home.
- Think about meeting with home health aides now, so you're ready if you ever need extra help after a fall.

## What To Do If You Fall

Even with all your preparations, falls can still happen. Knowing how to get up safely is key:

1. Roll onto your side then use your arms to push yourself up.
2. Use both hands to help turn yourself onto all fours.
3. Move into a kneeling position, using a chair or something sturdy for support if it's near.
4. Put one foot flat on the floor, like you're in a low lunge, then push yourself up to stand.

## Videos to Help You Practice

You can also find videos online that show you how to get up from a fall and exercises to prevent falls:

- **Fall Prevention Exercises**: A video by John Hopkins that teaches how to stand up from sitting and balance exercises.
- **Getting Up From a Fall**: This video from the American Heart Association shows how to get up with the help of a chair.
- **Tips for Seniors**: Kaiser Permanente has a video on making your home safer and the right way to fall to avoid injuries.

## Summary

Falls don't have to be a normal part of getting older. By staying strong and making your home safer, you can greatly reduce your risk of falling. And by planning ahead with your support network and knowing how to get up safely if you do fall, you'll be even better prepared. So consider CaredFor your partner in staying safe and maintaining your independence at home.
