# Navigating the Costs of Assisted Living: Discovering Affordable Solutions with CaredFor

As we get older, certain everyday tasks like making food, tidying up, or going shopping might become harder to do. This is when some folks think about moving into a place where they can get help, like an assisted living facility. But, paying for this kind of help can be pretty costly, and it might make people worried. Let's talk about how much it usually costs, who helps pay for it, and some other options that might save some money.

## How Much Does Assisted Living Typically Cost?

In 2019, the average cost each month for assisted living was $4,051, based on a study by Genworth Financial. That's quite a bit of money, especially when you compare it to what you might pay for rent or a mortgage. And if you need more specialized care, the cost can go up even more.

The price of assisted living can also change depending on where you live. In places where things generally cost more, like New York or New Jersey, assisted living can cost a lot more each month. But in states like Kentucky or Missouri, it might be a bit more affordable.

## Who Helps Pay for Assisted Living?

Often, people use their own money to pay for assisted living. But there are a few ways to help manage the costs. Some folks think that Medicare or Medicaid will cover the costs, but unfortunately, that's not the case. Here are some ways that might help:

- **Long-Term Care Insurance:** This can help with some of the costs if your policy includes assisted living.
- **Medicare:** It's important to know that Medicare doesn't cover the costs for long-term assisted living.
- **Medicaid:** Like Medicare, Medicaid doesnâ€™t cover the costs for room and board in assisted living.
- **Social Security:** While Social Security might help a bit, it usually isn't enough to cover all the costs.
- **VA Aid and Attendance:** If you're a veteran, this benefit might help cover some of the costs of assisted living.
- **Investment Options:** Things like life insurance settlements or reverse mortgages might be options to help pay for care.

## Living at Home: An Affordable Alternative

You might be surprised to learn that most older adults don't live in assisted living facilities or nursing homes. In fact, staying at home, often called "aging in place," can be a more budget-friendly option. There are lots of services that can help make living at home safer and easier, like delivering groceries, meals, or providing help with cleaning and repairs. Using ride-sharing services can also help if you don't drive.

Staying safe at home is important, and there are affordable ways to do that. For example, CaredFor offers a free daily check-in service for older adults living on their own. If you don't check in, CaredFor will let a loved one know to check up on you. This is a great way to stay independent, avoid the high costs of assisted living, and still have peace of mind.

Remember, finding the right solution can take some time, but with these options and tools like CaredFor, you can figure out a plan that works for your budget and keeps you safe and comfortable.
