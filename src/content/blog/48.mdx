# 5 Simple Ways to Quickly Lower Your Blood Pressure

Are you worried about high blood pressure? You're not alone. A large number of older adults deal with high blood pressure, but there's good news: it can be managed! By adopting some healthy habits, you can live a long and joyful life. Remember, this advice is for informational use only. Always talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure to create a plan that’s best for you.

## Quick Tips to Lower Your Blood Pressure

High blood pressure readings are anything over 130/80 mm Hg. Alongside medication your doctor may prescribe, here are five easy steps to help lower your blood pressure:

### 1. Keep an Eye on Your Weight

Gaining weight can make your blood pressure go up. Losing just a bit of weight can make a big difference in lowering it. Try to exercise more, walk instead of driving, and eat homemade meals rather than processed foods filled with salt.

### 2. Exercise Regularly

Staying active can help lower your blood pressure and keeps you feeling great. Both cardio and strength training are important. You can try simple exercises from home, like seated exercises, core strengthening, yoga, or tai-chi.

### 3. Eat Healthy

A good diet is key to lowering blood pressure. The DASH diet is great for this. It means eating fewer sweets and red meats, and more fruits, veggies, lean meats, and whole grains. Also, watch your salt intake, limit alcohol, and reduce caffeine.

### 4. Reduce Stress

Stress can make your blood pressure spike. Try to relax with deep breathing, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. It’s okay to ask for help with things that stress you out, like housework or errands.

### 5. Check Your Blood Pressure Regularly

Knowing your blood pressure numbers helps you manage them better. You can use a home blood pressure monitor to keep track.

### Don’t Forget About CaredFor

For older adults living alone with high blood pressure, consider using the CaredFor app. It’s a daily check-in app that lets your emergency contacts know if something might be wrong.
