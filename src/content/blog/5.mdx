# Community Spotlight: Meet Jan, The Heart Behind CaredFor

In our first-ever Community Spotlight, we take immense pride in introducing you to Jan, whose life journey represents the very spirit of CaredFor. Living in the sunny state of Florida, Jan’s remarkable story stretches across multiple states from Tennessee to Alaska, and even abroad to Cuba, illustrating her adventurous and compassionate spirit.

Jan’s zest for life is infectious. Her early days were grounded in hands-on nursing, a period during which she thrived on the frontlines of healthcare in the emergency room, later transitioning to the administrative side to enhance the quality of care through her love for math and science. Retirement didn’t slow her down; if anything, it amplified her adventurous spirit. Jan embraced bicycling, clocking in an impressive 3,000 miles a year. Her appetite for exploration led her to devise a meticulous plan to walk or cycle through every state in the U.S., a goal she proudly accomplished.

Life in Florida saw the birth of a Pickleball group and a Walking Club under Jan’s guidance. Her curiosity and eagerness to learn propelled her into teaching iPhone Tips & Tricks, aiding others in navigating the world of modern technology with ease. Jan’s personal superpower lies in her undying optimism, being a goal-oriented individual who finds joy in the simplest things life has to offer.

Despite facing two upcoming surgeries, Jan’s spirit remains unbroken. She’s focused on enjoying life to the fullest, eagerly anticipating the moment she can return to her love for traveling and exploring the world. Among her favored activities are walking, water exercises, and dancing, each a testament to her love for staying active and engaged with life.

Jan’s life is a blend of cherished moments spent with friends and family, and quiet evenings immersed in technology and music. She attributes part of her sense of safety and connectedness to CaredFor, which offers her comfort and peace of mind through its easy check-in system.

When asked about her guiding principles, Jan’s philosophy is simple – cherish each day and find joy in accomplishing the little things. Her advice to those living alone is heartfelt and practical – seek companionship, explore hobbies, and always stay open to new experiences. After all, it was her openness to new experiences that turned a solo breakfast at a McDonald’s into a lasting friendship.

Jan’s story is more than just an introduction; it's an invitation to embrace life with the same zeal and passion she embodies. Her journey and insights are a source of inspiration, reminding us of the possibilities that lie ahead when we approach life with an open heart and a curious mind.

As we celebrate Jan, the inspiration behind CaredFor, let’s carry forward her legacy of positivity, exploration, and never-ending learning. Here’s to living life to the fullest, just like Jan.
