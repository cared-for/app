# Navigating the Journey: A Guide to Senior Transportation with CaredFor

Being able to get around is super important for seniors who want to live on their own and keep doing the things they love. Going out to buy yummy food, seeing the doctor, or just hanging out with friends are things that help you stay happy and healthy. A big study found that almost 8 out of 10 caregivers help their family or friends get to where they need to go. Having a safe and reliable way to travel can make a huge difference, letting seniors enjoy their home life as long as possible.

Getting around can be a bit tricky when you can’t drive yourself, but there are lots of options out there for you. Whether it’s a bus, a taxi app on your phone, or a special service for medical visits, you've got choices. And, some services might even be covered by health insurance like Medicare or Medicaid. Plus, with a little help from some handy resources, finding transportation can be a breeze.

Safety first, though! If you’re going out, especially with others or on public transport, remember to keep wearing your mask and try to stay a little bit away from folks to keep safe and healthy.

## Finding Your Ride

Not sure where to start looking for transportation? No stress! Here are some cool resources:

1. **Dialing 211**: Just like asking for information, dialing 211 can connect you to helpful stuff in your community, including how to get around town.

2. **Eldercare Locator**: This service helps older adults find all kinds of help, including rides. Check their website or call them up at 800-677-1116.

3. **Local Area Agencies on Aging**: These agencies are all about helping seniors right in your neighborhood. They can point you to local transport services.

## Your Transportation Options

Here are some ways you might get around:

1. **Ride-Sharing Apps**: Apps like Uber or Lyft let you order a ride right from your phone. It’s like having a taxi at your fingertips.

2. **GoGoGrandparent**: If using a phone app isn’t your thing, GoGoGrandparent lets you order a ride with just a phone call. Super easy!

3. **Public Transit**: Buses and trains can get you where you need to go and are often less expensive. You can plan your trip using Google Maps to make it simpler.

4. **ADA and Paratransit**: If you find it hard to use regular public transport, these special services make sure you can still get to where you're going.

5. **Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT)**: For going to the doctor or medical appointments, there are special rides you can get, sometimes covered by insurance.

6. **Volunteer Driver Programs**: Some kind folks volunteer to drive seniors around for free. Check to see if there’s a program like this in your area.

Even though not being able to drive can feel like a big obstacle, with these options, you can still stay active, social, and most importantly, independent. And hey, don’t forget about CaredFor. It's a tool that helps you stay safe by checking in every day. If you don’t check in, it lets someone know to check on you. Pretty neat, right?

Staying independent and getting to where you need to go is totally possible with a little help from services like CaredFor and the other resources mentioned. So, keep enjoying your adventures and the freedom to move around as you like.
