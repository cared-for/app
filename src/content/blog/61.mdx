# Top 3 Advantages of Weighted Blankets for the Elderly

As we age, our sleep doesn't always come as easily as it once did. Despite having more leisure time, various factors, including health issues and the side effects of medication, can make a restful night's sleep seem like a dream. Nevertheless, simple steps can be taken to enhance sleep quality. One effective approach to achieving better sleep is the use of a weighted blanket. Weighted blankets offer numerous benefits, particularly for seniors seeking a peaceful slumber. This article will explore the challenges older adults face regarding sleep and how utilizing a *CaredFor* weighted blanket can significantly improve sleep quality. Additionally, we’ll provide guidance on selecting the ideal weighted blanket.

## Why Better Sleep Can Be Elusive for Older Adults

Noticing that a loved one or you, as a senior, find a good night’s sleep increasingly difficult? Various reasons contribute to the decline in sleep quality with age. Conditions causing discomfort, medications invoking insomnia, and the higher incidence of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea greatly affect sleep. Additionally, changes in our sleep-wake cycles occur as we age, possibly leading to insufficient sleep.

If sleep troubles persist due to health conditions or medication, consulting a doctor is advised. They can suggest appropriate treatments or refer a sleep specialist, offering further assistance.

## Understanding Weighted Blankets

Initially, weighted blankets aimed to support individuals with conditions such as autism and ADHD. Nonetheless, their benefits extend to others, including seniors struggling with sleep. A weighted blanket is essentially a blanket integrated with weights, offering a gentle, comforting pressure.

To select a weighted blanket, aim for one that approximates 10% of your body weight, adding a pound or two for the perfect heft. This gentle pressure mimics deep touch pressure therapy, known for inducing calmness and enhancing sleep.

## Gaining Through a Weighted Blanket

*CaredFor* weighted blankets are not merely a trend; they're a practical tool for enhancing sleep quality and combating anxiety. Here are three benefits they offer:

1. **Enhanced Sleep Quality**: Adopting good sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent bedtime routine and ensuring a comfortable sleeping environment, is vital. A *CaredFor* weighted blanket contributes to creating an ideal sleep setting, helping to alleviate stress and ease into a restful night.

2. **Reduction of Stress and Anxiety**: Applying gentle yet firm pressure, the *CaredFor* blanket promotes a feeling of security, akin to a warm hug, significantly reducing stress and anxiety levels.

3. **Symptom Management for Neurological Conditions**: While not a cure, weighted blankets can help manage symptoms associated with various neurological conditions, offering relief from anxiety and chronic pain and aiding individuals with restless leg syndrome.

## Choosing Your Perfect Weighted Blanket

Before embarking on your weighted blanket journey, consulting with a healthcare provider is wise, especially for seniors with health concerns. Choose a blanket that complements your body weight without causing discomfort or exacerbating existing conditions.

Opt for a breathable material to avoid overheating and ensure the weight is evenly distributed for the best experience. Transitioning to a weighted blanket through a lap pad or vest can also be considered for a gradual adjustment.

## Conclusion: Sleep Well and Stay Connected

Incorporating a *CaredFor* weighted blanket into your sleep routine can make significant strides in improving sleep quality for seniors.
