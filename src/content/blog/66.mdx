# Introducing New Daily Check-Ins for Extra Peace of Mind with CaredFor!

When Jan first had the brilliant idea for CaredFor, what made it stand out was how simple yet effective it was. CaredFor was born to perform one task exceptionally: ensuring safety and peace of mind with daily check-ins. As our CaredFor family has grown, we've tweaked and improved things here and there. However, we’ve steered clear of major changes to keep things simple. That is, until now! 

One request we’ve heard a lot is for the ability to have more than one check-in a day. We get it, sometimes 24 hours can feel like forever, especially when it comes to the well-being of our loved ones. That's why we're thrilled to let you know that CaredFor now offers the option to schedule several check-ins throughout your day, adding that extra layer of care and assurance you’ve been asking for.

### How Does It Work?

Good news, CaredFor family! You can now set up to three check-ins per day. It works just the same as your usual daily check-in. When it’s time, CaredFor will send you a reminder, and all you have to do is open the app and click the green button. If a check-in is missed, don’t worry, your emergency contacts will be promptly notified either by a text message (for those on the free plan) or a phone call (for those on the dispatch plan).

To ensure there’s enough time between your check-ins, they should be scheduled at least three hours apart. We recommend setting them for morning, noon, and night to cover your entire day.

### Ready to Get Started?

Want to add more check-ins? It’s easy! This new feature is available for an annual fee of $17.99. This small contribution helps us keep CaredFor running smoothly and allows us to continue making it even better for you.

To add multiple check-ins to your account, simply follow this link and make your payment. Don't forget to use the same cell phone number you registered with. 

**Notes:** 
- If you’re already enjoying our Dispatch plan, which is $9.99/month or $99/year, good news! You automatically get multiple check-in times at no extra cost. 
- Make sure your CaredFor app is updated to at least version 1.1.4 on Android or 2.3.2 on iOS to enjoy this new feature.
