# CaredFor Promises to Keep Prices Low Amidst Economic Changes

In a world where everything seems to cost more and more, we've got some good news. Here at CaredFor, we're dedicated to keeping things affordable for you. No matter what's happening in the economy, we want you to know that we've got your back.

Our essential service, which gives you a daily check-in to make sure you're doing alright, will continue to be offered for free. And our Dispatch Plan, where we'll send someone to check on you if we don't hear back from you, is staying at the low price of just $99 per year.

Why are we doing this? Because we believe that everyone deserves to feel safe and cared for, without having to worry about whether they can afford it. We know times are tough. Prices for basic needs like food and housing are going up. And on top of that, there are all the everyday challenges that life throws your way.

Our community includes seniors living on their own, pet lovers, military families, solo parents, and so many more. A lot of you are on fixed incomes that haven't caught up with rising costs. The last thing you need is to stress over a price hike for a service that offers you peace of mind.

Thinking about upgrading to our Dispatch Plan but worried about the cost? Please, shoot us an email at support@caredforsafety.com to talk about a discounted rate. And if you're happy with our free service, that's great too! Our main goal is to make sure you get the support you need.

Stay cared for,
The CaredFor Team
