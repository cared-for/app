# CaredFor Keeps Prices Low for Peace of Mind

In these times when prices are climbing everywhere you look, CaredFor promises to be the exception. We understand that everyone is feeling the pinch from inflation, with costs going up all around. That's precisely why we're staying firm in our commitment to not increase the prices on our services.

At the heart of CaredFor is our daily check-in service, designed to make sure you're doing alright, which we offer for free. For those who might need a bit more, like a visit coordinated by an emergency service dispatcher if a check-in is missed, we have our Dispatch Plan. Even with all the economic fluctuations, we're keeping it at its affordable rate of $99 per year.

Why, you may ask? It's simple. CaredFor was created with the core belief that everyone deserves to feel safe and cared for, without having to stretch their budget. Given the current economic challenges, including the steep rise in essential living costs, we recognize how important it is for our service to remain accessible. Our user base is diverse, spanning from seniors living independently and pet owners to military families and single parents, many of whom are on fixed incomes that haven't seen adjustments in line with inflation.

We know the last thing you need is worrying about affording a service that brings comfort and security to your life. So, if you've been thinking about our Dispatch Plan but are unsure about your budget right now, please get in touch with us at support@caredfor.com. We're open to discussing how we can make it work for you. Otherwise, we hope you continue to find value and reassurance in our free service.

Our top priority remains your wellbeing. We're here to ensure that you receive the support and care you need, without the financial pressure.

Warm wishes,
