# The Inspiration Behind CaredFor: A Tale of Independence and Safety

Meet Jan, a remarkable lady not content with the typical retiree lifestyle. At a stage where most enjoy their quiet time, Jan boasts a vibrant life filled with 6-mile daily walks, exploring all 50 states, and even leading a walking group in The Villages, Florida. But Jan isn’t just about physical fitness; she’s a tech enthusiast, well-versed in the world of smartphones, even teaching her peers to navigate the digital age seamlessly.

Despite her zest for life and independence, Jan, like many living alone with health concerns, faced a constant worry. With a heart condition and a history of medical scares, the fear of encountering an emergency without the ability to call for help loomed large. The thought of being incapacitated and unnoticed for days sent Jan on a quest for a solution, one that didn’t compromise her independence or brand her with the stigma of being vulnerable.

Jan’s search led her to scrutinize existing services like Life Alert. However, the drawbacks were immediately apparent: the devices were both aesthetically displeasing and technologically outdated, not to mention the steep monthly cost. More significantly, the service’s messaging and reliance on the user’s ability to press a button during a crisis clashed with Jan’s view of her own autonomy and resilience.

Unwilling to settle, Jan approached the creators of Patronus, an app she respected, with a unique proposal. She envisioned a service that would check in on her daily, prompting action only if she failed to respond. Her idea sparked innovation within the Patronus team, who quickly went to work, designing what would soon become a new safeguarding service.

The result was *CaredFor*, a service crafted with simplicity, reliability, and respect for the user’s independence at its core. With the help of Jan’s Apple User Group and her walking companions, the service was put to the test—a test it passed with flying colors. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with 93% of the retirees feeling more secure and 90% ready to recommend it to others.

Thanks to Jan’s determination and creative spirit, *CaredFor* now stands as a beacon of safety and independence for anyone living alone. It’s more than a service; it’s a testament to the fact that age or health concerns should never limit one’s desire for a vibrant, autonomous life.
