# Feeling Secure and Independent with CaredFor

When I hit 66, something in me changed. It wasn't just noticing a few more wrinkles or that my knees sounded like a bowl of rice krispies in the morning. It was deeper than that. My whole outlook on life started to evolve. Suddenly, the focus wasn't on going out or staying up late.

And letâ€™s not forget about cherishing those deep, meaningful friendships and spending time on hobbies that bring joy.
