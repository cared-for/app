# Embracing Independence with Heart Disease: How CaredFor Can Help

Living with heart disease can feel challenging, especially if you're doing it alone. But guess what? Science tells us that living by oneself doesn't necessarily make heart matters worse. In fact, a big study from 2019 looked at over 32,000 people from 45 different countries all living with heart disease. Around 11% were living solo. And after checking a bunch of health factors like age and whether they smoked or had diabetes, researchers found something pretty cool. Those living alone didn’t face a higher risk of heart issues like attacks or failure than those who lived with others.

Interestingly, there was a bit of a difference between men and women in the study. Men on their own had a slightly higher risk of heart problems, possibly because they lost social support after a breakup. Women living solo, though, actually had a bit of an edge when it came to avoiding heart attacks compared to those living with partners or friends. It’s thought that maybe, because women often take care of others and manage the house, they get really good at taking care of themselves too.

Older folks aged 75 and above living alone seemed to do even better, facing lower risks of heart problems. But younger people living alone showed a bit higher risks. This might be because younger folks often face more social pressures that can lead to unhealthy habits. So, it’s not about living alone that’s the big deal; it’s more about how we manage our health and our social connections.

Now, here’s a twist. While living alone itself isn’t a big heart health risk, feeling lonely is a whole different story. A study from Copenhagen University Hospital found that loneliness can seriously impact the health of people with heart disease, even more than just living alone does. Being lonely makes things tougher, leading to a higher risk of dying early, feeling more depressed or anxious, and having a lower quality of life.

So if the silent monster here is loneliness, what can you do about it? Start by recognizing that loneliness is just a feeling, not a fact. Don’t shut yourself in. Make an effort to connect with others, even if it feels like a big step. Do things you enjoy with groups like knitting clubs or hiking teams. Not only does that give you common ground with new people, making friends easier, but it also gives your mind a positive focus.

And remember, CaredFor is here for you! If you’re living with heart disease, you're not alone. There are loads of ways to tweak your lifestyle for a healthier heart. Quit smoking, eat healthier, get your cholesterol and blood pressure in check, manage stress, and brush those teeth! Also, getting enough sleep and avoiding sitting for too long are key. Oh, and steer clear of secondhand smoke - it’s bad news for your heart.
